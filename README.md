# Tetris

This is a simple Tetris game. It was created in parts using a tutorial by [FoX DeN](https://www.youtube.com/@FoXDeN). 

The number of blocks, their shape and their color can be changed by editing [blockData.json](./src/main/resources/blockData/blockData.json). The high score is stored inside the systems appdata folder at "*./tetris/highScore.txt*".
